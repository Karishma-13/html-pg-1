    <div class="div-4"><h2>About trees</h2>
    <p>Trees have been around for some 370 million years. These long-lived woody plants can befound on every continent except Antarctica. Scientists have identified more than 60,000tree species. And they’ve estimated that there are 3.04 trillion individual trees growingacross the globe.

    Trees provide homes for animals and shade for people on hot days. One of their bigbenefitsis that they soak up and store the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Some peoplehave suggestedthat planting trees could help to negate the impact of global warming.Researchers lastyear, though, warned that the easy and simple idea wasn’t so easy andsimple after all. Itwould be difficult to plant enough trees. However, planting treescould help — if donethoughtfully, and in the right places.
